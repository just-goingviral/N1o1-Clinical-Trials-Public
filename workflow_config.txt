The current workflow configuration for "Start application" has an issue with the PORT environment variable.

To fix this, you'll need to manually update the workflow in your Replit settings by following these steps:

1. Click on the "Run" button dropdown (top center of the screen)
2. Select "Configure Runs" option
3. Find and edit the "Start application" workflow
4. Replace the command:
   `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --reuse-port --reload main:app`

   With:
   `PORT=5000 gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port --reload main:app`

5. Click "Save changes"

This explicitly sets the port to 5000 in both the environment variable and the binding address.

Alternatively, you can continue using the start_app.sh script I created which already works:
`./start_app.sh`
