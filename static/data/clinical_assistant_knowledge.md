## üß¨ Nitric Oxide (NO) Basics

Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule produced naturally in the body that plays critical roles in:
- Vasodilation and blood pressure regulation
- Platelet aggregation inhibition
- Neurotransmission
- Immune system response
- Wound healing
- Cellular respiration

The half-life of NO in the bloodstream is extremely short (seconds), making direct supplementation challenging. Therefore, precursors like nitrite (NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª) are used therapeutically.

## üìä N1O1 Products

Our N1O1 product line includes:
- **N1O1 Lozenges**: Proprietary formulation delivering nitrite and nitrate precursors
- **NO Beetz**: Concentrated beetroot supplement rich in natural nitrates
- **N1O1 Complete**: Comprehensive formula supporting multiple NO pathways

These products are designed to enhance NO bioavailability through various mechanisms:
1. Nitrate-Nitrite-NO pathway
2. Enzymatic NOS (Nitric Oxide Synthase) stimulation
3. Redox balance optimization

## üè• Clinical Applications

Nitric oxide therapy has shown promise in:

**Cardiovascular Health:**
- Reducing blood pressure
- Improving endothelial function
- Enhancing exercise capacity in heart failure patients
- Supporting healthy circulation

**Ischemic Heart Disease:**
- Increasing blood flow to ischemic areas
- Reducing myocardial oxygen demand
- Limiting reperfusion injury
- Inhibiting platelet aggregation and thrombus formation

**Additional Applications:**
- Wound healing
- Erectile dysfunction
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Antimicrobial activity
- Cognitive function

## üî¨ Research Protocol

The current clinical trial focuses on ischemic heart disease patients with the following parameters:
- **Baseline Assessment**: Plasma NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª levels, endothelial function, exercise capacity
- **Intervention**: N1O1 Lozenge supplementation (30mg, 2x daily)
- **Follow-up**: Plasma measurements at 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h post-dose on days 1, 7, and 28
- **Endpoints**: Change in plasma NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª, endothelial function, symptoms, exercise capacity

## üíª App Features

The N1O1 Clinical Trials platform enables:
- Patient database management
- Simulation of NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª pharmacokinetics
- Data visualization and interpretation
- AI-powered clinical note generation
- Research documentation and export

## üß™ Technical Details

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- Baseline NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª: 0.1-0.3 ŒºM in healthy individuals
- Time to peak: ~30 minutes post-oral administration
- Elimination half-life: ~30-45 minutes (age-dependent)
- Bioavailability: ~98% for the lozenge formulation

**Sample Collection Protocol:**
- Fasting blood draw recommended
- Process within 30 minutes
- Centrifuge at 1000g for 10 minutes at 4¬∞C
- Store plasma at -80¬∞C until analysis
- Analysis via chemiluminescence or Griess reaction

## üî¨ Simulation Capabilities of the App

The N1O1 Clinical Trials App allows:
- Simulation of NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª levels over time after dosing
- Modeling based on individual age, weight, and baseline nitrite
- Support for HillTau and compartmental pharmacokinetic models
- Output of plasma NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª curves used to:
  - Optimize dosing schedules
  - Compare supplement effects
  - Visualize therapeutic windows

Data is stored in a PostgreSQL backend and linked to each patient's profile. Results can be exported or compared to real clinical data.
