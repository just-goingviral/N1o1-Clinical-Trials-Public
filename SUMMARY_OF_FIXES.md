# N1O1 Clinical Trials - Summary of Deployment Fixes

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **URL Generation and Redirect Loops**
   - Updated `safe_url_for()` to intelligently detect the deployment environment
   - Added dynamic URL scheme detection based on proxy headers
   - Removed hardcoded HTTP scheme references

2. **Session and Cookie Configuration**
   - Made cookie security settings consistent
   - Removed duplicate configuration blocks
   - Ensured cross-domain compatibility of cookie settings

3. **Proxy Handling**
   - Properly configured ProxyFix middleware to handle forwarded headers
   - Made the app respect X-Forwarded-Proto for protocol detection
   - Ensured correct URL generation behind load balancers/CDNs

4. **Workflow Reliability**
   - Created fixed workflow script that uses reliable hardcoded settings
   - Prevented empty PORT variable errors
   - Implemented proper process cleanup before startup

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Dynamic URL Protocol:**
  When generating URLs, the application now:
  1. Checks X-Forwarded-Proto headers to detect HTTPS
  2. Falls back to configured PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME if headers are missing
  3. Ensures HTTP scheme for Replit's internal domain

- **Intelligent Redirects:**
  All redirects now use `safe_redirect()` which:
  1. Uses `safe_url_for()` to generate the URL
  2. Maintains the original protocol (http/https)
  3. Generates fully qualified URLs with the correct hostname

- **Fixed ProxyFix Configuration:**
  The application correctly handles:
  1. X-Forwarded-For for client IP
  2. X-Forwarded-Proto for protocol detection
  3. X-Forwarded-Host for hostname/domain
  4. X-Forwarded-Port for port detection
  5. X-Forwarded-Prefix for path prefixes

## Verification Tools

- **verify_deployment.py**
  - Tests basic connectivity
  - Verifies correct redirect handling
  - Works with both Replit and custom domains

- **workflow_fixed.sh**
  - Ensures reliable application startup
  - Uses hardcoded port to prevent workflow issues
  - Handles proper process cleanup
