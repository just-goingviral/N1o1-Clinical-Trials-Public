# N1O1 Clinical Trials - Summary of Deployment Fixes

## Core Issue

The main deployment issue was the handling of the `$PORT` environment variable in Replit's workflow system, which often results in a `Error: '' is not a valid port number` error because the variable is empty or not properly set.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Standalone Server Scripts:**
   - `simple_start.py`: Super minimal Flask server with hardcoded port 5003
   - `start_n1o1_standalone.py`: Basic server with key routes but no complex initialization
   - `minimal_flask_server.py`: Minimal server with health check endpoints

2. **Shell Scripts:**
   - `fixed_workflow.sh`: Explicitly sets environment variables and runs the standalone server
   - `workflow_fixed.sh`: Alternative script that just runs the standalone server

3. **Configuration Files:**
   - `new_workflow.toml`: Sample workflow configuration with hardcoded port
   - `.replit.new`: Completely rewritten configuration file (needs to be manually copied to .replit)
   - `WORKFLOW_FIXED_COMMAND.txt`: Recommended workflow command

## How to Fix the Workflow

Since you can't directly edit the `.replit` file, you'll need to update the workflow through Replit's UI:

1. Go to Tools > Workflows
2. Edit "Start application" workflow
3. Replace the command with `python simple_start.py`
4. Save the workflow

Alternatively, you can try using one of the other provided solutions:

- `python start_n1o1_standalone.py` - More complete server but still minimal
- `./fixed_workflow.sh` - Shell script with environment variables set

## Verification

We've verified that all the alternative server implementations work when run directly, but the workflow system still has issues with environment variables.

## Post-Deployment Steps

Once deployed, verify the application is running by visiting:

- Replit URL + `/ping` - Should return `{"status": "ok"}`
- Replit URL + `/system/health` - Should return system status information
