# ðŸš¨ SECURITY NOTICE - CREDENTIAL EXPOSURE INCIDENT

**Date**: June 14, 2025  
**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Status**: Partially Mitigated

## Summary

The `.env` file containing sensitive credentials was accidentally committed to this public GitHub repository. While the file has now been removed, the exposed credentials should be considered **COMPROMISED** and must be rotated immediately.

## Exposed Credentials

The following credentials were exposed and need immediate rotation:

### 1. **Database Credentials (PostgreSQL - Neon)**
- Database URL
- Database name, host, port
- Username and password
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Rotate database password immediately via Neon dashboard

### 2. **API Keys**
- **Anthropic API Key** (sk-ant-api03-...)
- **OpenAI API Key** (sk-proj--1bPN...)
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Regenerate both API keys from respective dashboards

### 3. **Application Secrets**
- SECRET_KEY
- SESSION_SECRET
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Generate new secret keys for the application

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Rotate ALL exposed credentials**:
   - [ ] Change PostgreSQL password in Neon dashboard
   - [ ] Regenerate Anthropic API key
   - [ ] Regenerate OpenAI API key
   - [ ] Generate new SECRET_KEY and SESSION_SECRET

2. **Update local .env file** with new credentials

3. **Monitor for unauthorized access**:
   - Check database access logs
   - Review API usage for both Anthropic and OpenAI
   - Monitor for any suspicious activity

4. **Consider additional security measures**:
   - Enable 2FA on all services if not already enabled
   - Set up API key usage alerts
   - Implement IP whitelisting where possible

## Prevention Measures

1. **Never commit .env files** - Already in .gitignore
2. **Use environment variables** in production
3. **Consider using secrets management services** (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
4. **Regular security audits** of the repository

## Important Notes

- Even though the file has been removed from the current version, it still exists in the Git history
- Anyone who accessed the repository between the exposure and removal could have copied these credentials
- This is why immediate rotation is critical

## Contact

If you notice any suspicious activity or have questions about this incident, please contact the security team immediately.
