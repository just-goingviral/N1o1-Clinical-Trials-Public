   ```

4. Run linting (when available):
   ```bash
   flake8 .
   black .
   ```

5. Commit with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new simulation parameter for hypoxia"
   ```

6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Open a Pull Request

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example:
```python
def calculate_nitrite_clearance(
    concentration: float, 
    egfr: float = 90.0
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate nitrite clearance based on kidney function.
    
    Args:
        concentration: Plasma nitrite concentration in ÂµM
        egfr: Estimated glomerular filtration rate in mL/min
        
    Returns:
        Clearance rate in ÂµM/min
    """
    return concentration * (egfr / 60.0) * 0.1
```

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer const/let over var
- Use meaningful component names
- Add JSDoc comments

### Git Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_simulation.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases

Example:
```python
def test_nitrite_simulation_with_renal_impairment():
    """Test simulation accurately models reduced clearance with low eGFR"""
    sim = NODynamicsSimulator(dose=30.0, egfr=30.0)
    results = sim.simulate()
    
    # Verify higher AUC with impaired renal function
    assert results['auc'] > normal_auc
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Include examples in documentation

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation
3. Add entry to CHANGELOG (if exists)
