# Fixing the 404 Error on Your Netlify Site

Based on our diagnostic tests, your Netlify site `neral-kataifi-590c5c.netlify.app` is returning a **404 Not Found** error, not a redirect loop. This means the site is either not properly deployed or the content is missing.

## Solutions to Try

### 1. Check Your Netlify Deployment

1. **Verify deployment status:**
   - Log in to your Netlify dashboard
   - Check that your site has successfully deployed
   - Look for any build errors in the deploy logs

2. **Verify publish directory:**
   - Make sure the "Publish directory" setting is correct
   - For a basic static site, this should typically be the root folder or a build folder like `public` or `dist`

3. **Check for a _redirects file:**
   - If you have a `_redirects` file, ensure it's not incorrectly routing all traffic

### 2. Create a Basic Index.html for Testing

Create a simple `index.html` file in your project root:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Test Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a test page to confirm Netlify deployment.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Deploy this to confirm basic functionality.

### 3. Check DNS Settings (If Using a Custom Domain)

If you're attempting to use a custom domain:
1. Verify DNS records are correctly pointing to Netlify
2. Ensure the domain is properly added in your Netlify site settings

### 4. Check for Conflicts with Replit

Since you're seeing this in the context of a Replit project:
1. Make sure you're not confusing the Replit URL with your Netlify URL
2. Verify how you're deploying from Replit to Netlify (manual upload, Git integration, etc.)

### 5. Test Your Site Locally Before Deploying

Run your site locally to make sure it works before deploying:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

## Next Steps

After implementing these fixes:
1. Redeploy your site to Netlify
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try accessing the site again 
4. Check the Netlify deploy logs for any remaining issues

If you continue to see issues, there may be a problem with your Netlify account or site configuration that requires direct support from Netlify.
