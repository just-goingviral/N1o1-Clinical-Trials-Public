# N1O1 Clinical Trials: Personalized Nitric Oxide Therapy Platform

N1O1 Clinical Trials is a comprehensive research platform built in collaboration with Dr. Nathan S. Bryan to support personalized nitric oxide therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions.

### üß† Core Capabilities
- Simulates plasma nitrite (NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª) levels over time after dosing with N1O1 products (e.g., Lozenges, NO Beetz)
- Tracks individual patient responses using a PostgreSQL database
- Supports HillTau and compartmental pharmacokinetic models
- Includes an AI assistant (`N1O1ai`) to guide researchers and doctors through the app
- Features advanced AI-powered clinical tools for patient management

### üî¨ Use Cases
- Model the effect of NO supplementation over time
- Plan patient-specific dosing schedules
- Record clinical trial data including dose, plasma response, and simulation curves
- Generate AI-powered clinical notes, consent forms, and reports
- Ask N1O1ai anything about nitric oxide research, trial goals, or product use

### üöÄ Technologies Used
- Flask + SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate
- PostgreSQL database
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Electron (for desktop app)
- OpenAI and Anthropic Claude AI models (branded as `N1O1ai`)
- Responsive web design for mobile and desktop access

### üß™ AI Clinical Tools (NEW)
The platform now includes advanced AI-powered clinical trial tools:

- **Pre-screening Analysis**: `/api/ai-tools/pre-screening` - Analyze patient eligibility for clinical trials based on inclusion/exclusion criteria
- **Clinical Note Generator**: `/api/ai-tools/generate-note` - Generate structured SOAP notes from visit data
- **Patient Sentiment Analysis**: `/api/ai-tools/patient-sentiment` - Analyze patient feedback for sentiment and key themes
- **Dynamic Consent Forms**: `/api/ai-tools/dynamic-consent` - Generate personalized consent forms based on patient demographics
- **AI Report Writer**: `/api/ai-tools/ai-report-writer` - Create detailed research reports from clinical trial data

### ü©∫ For Clinical Researchers
This platform visualizes how nitric oxide supplements affect NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª levels in various patient populations. It's designed to help clinicians evaluate patient responses, optimize treatment protocols, and streamline clinical trial workflows.
