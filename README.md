# Nitrite Dynamics: Personalized Nitric Oxide Therapy Assistant

Nitrite Dynamics is a clinical research app built by JustGoingViral in collaboration with Dr. Nathan S. Bryan to support personalized nitric oxide therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease.

### üß† What the App Does
- Simulates plasma nitrite (NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª) levels over time after dosing with N1O1 products (e.g., Lozenges, NO Beetz).
- Tracks individual patient responses using a PostgreSQL database.
- Supports HillTau and compartmental pharmacokinetic models.
- Includes an AI assistant (`N1O1ai`) to guide researchers and doctors through the app.

### üî¨ Use Cases
- Model the effect of NO supplementation over time.
- Plan patient-specific dosing schedules.
- Record clinical trial data including dose, plasma response, and simulation curves.
- Ask N1O1ai anything about nitric oxide research, trial goals, or product use.

### üöÄ Technologies Used
- Flask + SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate
- PostgreSQL
- Chart.js (coming soon)
- Electron (for desktop app)
- OpenAI (under the hood) ‚Äî branded as `N1O1ai` and fully private-labeled

### ü©∫ For Dr. Nathan Bryan
This app visualizes how nitric oxide supplements affect NO‚ÇÇ‚Åª levels. It's designed to help clinicians evaluate patient responses, optimize protocols, and simplify clinical trial workflows.
