# N1O1 Clinical Trials - Status and Fixes

## Recent Improvements

1. **Enhanced UI Interaction**
   - Added button-fix.js to repair common UI interaction issues
   - Implemented scientific term tooltips with mobile-friendly UI
   - Fixed tab navigation and card interaction bugs

2. **Research Insights Generator**
   - Added new Research Insights feature to dashboard
   - Created research_routes.py with multiple insight types
   - Implemented visualization capabilities for research data

3. **Deployment Stability**
   - Created multiple direct-start options that bypass Replit workflow system:
     - `start_direct.py` - Python direct starter
     - `start_gunicorn.sh` - Gunicorn direct starter with fixed port
     - `reliable_start.py` - Reliable starter with error handling 
   - Fixed route conflicts and duplicate function declarations
   - Fixed redirect issues by properly ordering function definitions

4. **Bootstrap Styling Enhancements**
   - Added tooltip-fix.css for scientific term explanations
   - Improved mobile responsiveness
   - Fixed button interaction issues

## Known Issues

1. **Replit Workflow Limitations**
   - The Replit workflow system sometimes fails to set the PORT environment variable
   - Solution: Use the direct starter scripts instead

2. **UI Interaction**
   - Some buttons may not respond to direct clicks
   - Solution: The button-fix.js enhances the clickable area to make buttons more responsive

## Starting the Application

Use one of these commands to start the application reliably:

```bash
# Option 1: Gunicorn direct starter
./start_gunicorn.sh

# Option 2: Python direct starter
python start_direct.py

# Option 3: Reliable Python starter
python reliable_start.py
```

## Research Insights Feature

The new Research Insights Generator is available at `/research/insights` and can be accessed directly from the dashboard. It provides:

- Connection discovery between research entities
- Hypothesis generation based on existing research
- Mechanism explanation for biological processes
- Clinical insights for research application
