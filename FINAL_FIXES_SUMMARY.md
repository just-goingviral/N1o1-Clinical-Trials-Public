# N1O1 Clinical Trials - Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Too Many Redirects Issue
The application was caught in a redirect loop when accessing certain pages. This was caused by:
- Inconsistent URL scheme handling (http vs https)
- Cookie security settings incompatible with the URL scheme
- Improper handling of proxy headers

### 2. Workflow Startup Issue
The workflow failed to start with the error "'' is not a valid port number" because:
- The PORT environment variable was empty
- The gunicorn command depended on this variable

## Solutions Implemented

### Redirect Loop Fixes
1. **URL Generation**:
   - Modified `safe_url_for` function to use a consistent HTTP scheme
   - Updated redirection logic to use this function with correct parameters

2. **Cookie Settings**:
   - Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False` to allow cookies over HTTP
   - Updated session configuration to be consistent with URL scheme

3. **Server Configuration**:
   - Set `SERVER_NAME = None` to dynamically detect domain from request
   - Set `PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME = 'http'` to ensure consistent URL generation

4. **Proxy Handling**:
   - Optimized ProxyFix middleware with correct parameters
   - Simplified configuration to focus on essential headers

### Workflow Fixes
1. **Fixed Command Scripts**:
   - Created `fixed_workflow_command.sh` with hardcoded port
   - Created `workflow_fixed.sh` with environment variables and fixed port
   - Documented how to update the workflow command in Replit UI

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Created `.env` file with correct environment settings
   - Documented which variables are needed for proper functioning

## Files Created

### Fix Scripts
- `fix_too_many_redirects.py`: Updates main.py to prevent redirect loops
- `fix_workflow.py`: Creates a workflow script with fixed port
- `fixed_workflow_command.sh`: Simple script with hardcoded port for workflow

### Documentation
- `REDIRECT_FIX_GUIDE.md`: Explains redirect loop causes and solutions
- `WORKFLOW_FIX.md`: Instructions for fixing the workflow configuration
- `WORKFLOW_COMMAND.txt`: Contains the fixed command for the workflow
- `FINAL_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`: This comprehensive summary

## How to Start the Application

### Option 1: Using the Fixed Workflow
1. Update the workflow command in Replit UI:
   ```
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port --reload main:app
   ```
2. Run the workflow

### Option 2: Using the Fixed Script
Run the following command in the terminal:
```
./fixed_workflow_command.sh
```

## Verification
After applying these fixes:
1. The application starts correctly without port errors
2. Pages load without redirect loops
3. The application works consistently across different domains
