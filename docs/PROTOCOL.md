### Secondary Endpoints
1. Change in plasma nitrite levels
2. Change in blood pressure
3. Change in exercise capacity
4. Pharmacokinetic parameters
5. Safety and tolerability

### Exploratory Endpoints
1. Biomarker signatures predictive of response
2. Circadian rhythm effects
3. Quality of life improvements
4. AI-predicted vs actual outcomes

## Study Medications

- With or without food
- Consistent timing required

## Safety Monitoring

### Safety Parameters
1. Vital signs at each visit
2. ECG at screening, Week 6, Week 12
3. Laboratory safety panel monthly
4. Adverse event monitoring (continuous)

### Stopping Rules
Individual stopping criteria:
- Sustained hypotension (<90/60 mmHg)
- Severe adverse event related to study drug
- Pregnancy during study
- Withdrawal of consent

Study stopping criteria:
- >20% serious adverse events
- Regulatory requirement

## Data Management

### Data Collection
1. Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF)
2. Real-time monitoring data streams
3. AI-processed clinical notes
4. Wearable device integration

### Quality Control
1. 100% source data verification for primary endpoint
2. Regular monitoring visits
3. Automated data quality checks
4. AI-assisted anomaly detection

## Statistical Analysis

### Sample Size Calculation
- Power: 80%
- Alpha: 0.05 (two-sided)
- Expected difference: 2% improvement in FMD
- Standard deviation: 3%
- Dropout rate: 15%

### Analysis Populations
1. **Intent-to-Treat (ITT)**: All randomized subjects
2. **Per-Protocol (PP)**: Completed ≥80% doses
3. **Safety**: All subjects receiving ≥1 dose

### Statistical Methods
1. Primary analysis: ANCOVA with baseline as covariate
2. Secondary analyses: Mixed-effects models
3. Subgroup analyses: Machine learning clustering
4. Missing data: Multiple imputation
